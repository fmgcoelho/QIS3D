  abstract = {{We review more than 200 applications of neural networks in image
	processing and discuss the present and possible future role of neural
	networks, especially feed-forward neural networks, Kohonen feature
	maps and Hopfield neural networks. The various applications are categorised
	into a novel two-dimensional taxonomy for image processing algorithms.
	One dimension specifies the type of task performed by the algorithm:
	preprocessing, data reduction/feature extraction, segmentation, object
	recognition, image understanding and optimisation. The other dimension
	captures the abstraction level of the input data processed by the
	algorithm: pixel-level, local feature-level, structure-level, object-level,
	object-set-level and scene characterisation. Each of the six types
	of tasks poses specific constraints to a neural-based approach. These
	specific conditions are discussed in detail. A synthesis is made
	of unresolved problems related to the application of pattern recognition
	techniques in image processing and specifically to the application
	of neural networks. Finally, we present an outlook into the future
	application of neural networks and relate them to novel developments.}},
